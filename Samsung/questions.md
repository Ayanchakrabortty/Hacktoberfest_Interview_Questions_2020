Q1. Find the largest prime factor of a given number.

Q2.  Given a binary tree and data value of a node. The task is to find the sum of cousin nodes of a given node. If a given node has no cousins then return -1.

Q3. Given a gold mine of n*m dimensions. Each field in this mine contains a positive integer which is the amount of gold in tons. Initially the miner is at first column but can be at any row. He can move only (right->,right up /,right down\) that is from a given cell, the miner can move to the cell diagonally up towards the right or right or diagonally down towards the right. Find out the maximum amount of gold he can collect.
