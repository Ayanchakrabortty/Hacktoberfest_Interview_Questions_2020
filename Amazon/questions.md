    There are various varieties of clothes (say shirt). Varieties are based on parameters like pattern, size, color, etc.
    a. What will be your input format so that it can store all values of all parameters?
    List<List<String>>. Each List<String> denotes values for a particular parameter
    b. Design a class for a shirt for the same requirement.
    c. You have to return all different types of shirts that can be formed based on various combinations of input parameters. (Code)
    d. Assuming you have all types of shirts available. Now there are various queries like:
        i. Show all types of shirts having color “red”,
        ii. Show all types of shirts having size “small” and pattern “check” etc. etc.
    So how will you store I/P so that this requirement can be fulfilled efficiently?
// Find the char occurring max no of times.
// Given a matrix and there will be bombs in the cells, find the number of blasts. A group of connected bombs leads to blast.
// Level order traversal of a tree.
// Given a sorted array and an element x, find k closest elements to the x in an array.
// Sort the given linked list.
// Top view of a tree.
